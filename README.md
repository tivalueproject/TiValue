### Getting Started
---------------
#### Basic concepts
* wallet – The wallet must be created before any other operations.
* account - An account corresponds to a private key (with an address). The account belongs to the wallet, and is shown by name in the wallet.
* address - The address is a unique identifier on the blockchain. It is also an account on the blockchain.
* unlock - Unlock the corresponding lock. For the sake of security, each wallet is protected with a password. Open and unlock the wallet before use.
* TV uses the consensus mechanism of DPOS, and the standard block interval is 10 seconds.

#### Assets

* There are a variety of assets in the TV system, of which the core asset is TV. The way for exchanges to list other assets within the TV system is similar to the way to list the core asset (TV).
* Each account can have multiple assets at the same time.
